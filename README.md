# Spring Boot REST API
This repository contains a simple yet comprehensive REST API built using Spring Boot. The main goal of this project is to showcase my skills in Spring Boot, aiming to deepen and master my knowledge of the framework through practical application.

Throughout the project, I incorporate different dependencies as part of my learning process and to enhance the overall implementation of the REST API. Currently, the dependencies being used include:
- Spring Data JPA

## Run Locally
**Important:** As of now, this repository does not include a Docker setup to run the application.  Updates will incorporate Docker integration in the near future, offering a convenient way to run and test the application effortlessly. For the time being, to maintain security and avoid unintentional exposure of local credentials, the `application.properties` file is intentionally left empty.
